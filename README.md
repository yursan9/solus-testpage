# Solus Printer Test Page

Do you like printing test page? I DO! And default Solus test page is not really consistent with their overall design anyway.

**NOTE**: This is not officially endorse by Solus Project team in any way.

## Feature

- CMYK and RGB color checker
- Margin border to check your print area border

## How to use

Copy and overwrite the `default-testpage.pdf` to `/usr/share/cups/data/default-testpage.pdf`. If you fond of the default test page, backup the builtin test page first.

Or, you can use simple shell script that I provided. It's automatically back up your default test page first.

```
./install.sh
```
